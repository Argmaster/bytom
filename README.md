# Bytom

Bytom is collective name of a 32-bit virtual hardware platform with a custom 32-bit ISA
and tools for generating bytecode for the platform. The platform is designed to be a
simplified model of a real-world hardware. Currently the platform is in early stage of
development with no way of compiling assembly or running the bytecode, come back in a
few weeks or months :D
